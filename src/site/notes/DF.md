## **Section I (Compulsory to Solve All Questions)**

### **1. (a) Explain Various Challenges in Digital Forensics.** _(5 Marks)_

Digital forensics involves collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence for legal or investigative purposes. However, investigators face several challenges, including:

1. **Rapidly Evolving Technology:** New devices, software, and encryption methods make it difficult to standardize forensic tools.
2. **Encryption and Anti-Forensics Techniques:** Cybercriminals use encryption, steganography, and data obfuscation to hide or erase digital footprints.
3. **Volatility of Digital Evidence:** Digital evidence can be easily altered, deleted, or overwritten, making preservation a critical challenge.
4. **Legal and Jurisdictional Issues:** Different countries have different laws regarding digital forensics, making cross-border investigations complex.
5. **Large Volumes of Data:** Investigators must analyze massive amounts of data, requiring efficient tools and techniques.
6. **Cloud Computing Challenges:** Cloud data is often stored in multiple locations, making evidence collection and jurisdiction difficult.
7. **Lack of Standardized Procedures:** There is no universal standard for digital forensics, leading to variations in methodology and tools.
8. **Resource Constraints:** Digital forensic investigations require specialized tools and trained professionals, which can be expensive.

### **1. (b) Elaborate the Significance of a Restore Point.** _(5 Marks)_

A **restore point** is a system feature that helps revert a computer to a previous state in case of system failures or malware attacks. Its significance includes:

1. **System Recovery:** Allows users to recover a system to a functional state if errors or malware infections occur.
2. **Data Protection:** Helps prevent data loss by restoring system files without affecting personal data.
3. **Time-Efficient Troubleshooting:** Reduces the need for extensive troubleshooting and reinstallation of operating systems.
4. **Security Enhancement:** Can help revert malicious changes caused by ransomware or unauthorized system modifications.
5. **Prevention of Permanent Data Loss:** Enables rollback in case of accidental software uninstallation or configuration changes.

## **Section II (Answer Any 2 Questions)**

### **2. Discuss Forensics and Elaborate on Any Two Computer Forensics Software Tools.** _(10 Marks)_

#### **Digital Forensics Overview**

Digital forensics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving electronic evidence to investigate cybercrimes, security breaches, and other digital incidents. It involves identifying, acquiring, preserving, examining, and presenting digital evidence in a legally admissible manner.

#### **Two Computer Forensics Software Tools**

1. **Autopsy & The Sleuth Kit:**
    
    - Open-source forensic tool used for hard drive analysis.
    - Supports file recovery, timeline analysis, and keyword searching.
    - Extracts deleted files and analyzes metadata.
    - Useful for law enforcement and cybersecurity investigations.
2. **FTK (Forensic Toolkit):**
    
    - Developed by AccessData, FTK provides an advanced forensic investigation platform.
    - Features include email analysis, memory analysis, and registry examination.
    - Uses indexing for fast data searching and pattern recognition.
    - Supports hashing, decryption, and file carving.

These tools help forensic analysts recover, analyze, and present digital evidence efficiently.

### **3. Discuss the Key Steps and Methodologies in the Digital Forensics Process.** _(10 Marks)_

Digital forensics follows a structured methodology to ensure the integrity of evidence and its admissibility in court. The key steps include:

1. **Identification:**
    
    - Recognizing potential sources of digital evidence (e.g., hard drives, mobile devices, cloud storage).
2. **Preservation:**
    
    - Isolating and securing evidence to prevent data alteration.
    - Creating forensic copies (bit-by-bit images) of storage media.
3. **Collection:**
    
    - Gathering relevant digital evidence using forensic tools.
    - Ensuring data is collected legally and ethically.
4. **Examination & Analysis:**
    
    - Using forensic techniques to recover hidden or deleted files.
    - Analyzing logs, metadata, and network traffic to find suspicious activities.
5. **Documentation & Reporting:**
    
    - Recording all findings in detail.
    - Preparing a report that explains forensic results in an understandable format.
6. **Presentation:**
    
    - Presenting evidence in court or to stakeholders with proper documentation.

Each step is crucial in ensuring that the evidence remains tamper-proof and legally valid.

### **4. Illustrate How Different File Systems Manage Storage and Retrieval of Data.** _(10 Marks)_

File systems manage how data is stored, organized, and retrieved on a storage device. Different file systems operate in distinct ways:

1. **FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32):**
    
    - Used in USB drives and older Windows systems.
    - Uses a table to track file locations.
    - Limited file size (4GB max) and lacks modern security features.
2. **NTFS (New Technology File System):**
    
    - Default file system for Windows.
    - Supports large file sizes, access control lists (ACLs), and encryption.
    - Uses the Master File Table (MFT) for efficient data retrieval.
3. **ext4 (Fourth Extended File System):**
    
    - Default file system for Linux distributions.
    - Features journaling for data integrity and efficient indexing.
    - Supports large volumes and fast retrieval times.
4. **HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus):**
    
    - Used in older macOS versions.
    - Optimized for Apple systems with metadata-based searching.
5. **APFS (Apple File System):**
    
    - Modern macOS file system with enhanced speed and encryption.
    - Uses snapshots for data backup and quick retrieval.

Each file system is designed to optimize data management based on its intended use and operating system.

### **5. Discuss the Phases of Digital Forensics Investigation with Examples.** _(10 Marks)_

Digital forensics investigations follow structured phases to ensure evidence is properly handled:

1. **Preparation:**
    
    - Setting up tools and defining the investigation scope.
    - Example: A company preparing for a forensic audit after a data breach.
2. **Identification:**
    
    - Determining sources of evidence (e.g., hard drives, emails, logs).
    - Example: Identifying a compromised server in a hacking incident.
3. **Collection & Preservation:**
    
    - Creating forensic images and preventing data tampering.
    - Example: Cloning a suspect's hard drive to analyze deleted files.
4. **Examination & Analysis:**
    
    - Extracting, filtering, and analyzing relevant evidence.
    - Example: Finding suspicious login attempts in server logs.
5. **Documentation & Reporting:**
    
    - Summarizing findings in a forensic report.
    - Example: Presenting evidence of an insider threat attack in court.
6. **Presentation:**
    
    - Testifying in court or sharing results with authorities.
    - Example: A forensic expert explaining malware analysis results in a cybercrime trial.

Each phase is critical in ensuring a systematic and defensible investigation.
